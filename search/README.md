This project imitate the front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search. Any query made would be redirected to Google. Written purely in HTML and CSS. 

## Instalation
To run this project, you can directly open index.html on live server. 

## Features 
- **Text Query**: Users can type in a query in the search box, click “Google Search”, and they will taken to the Google search results for that page. 
- **Image Query**: On the Google Image Search page, users can type in a query, click a search button, they will be taken to the Google Image search results for that page.
- **Advanced Search**: On the Google Advanced Search page, users can provide input for the following four fields (taken from Google’s own advanced search options):
    * Find pages with… “all these words:”
    * Find pages with… “this exact word or phrase:”
    * Find pages with… “any of these words:”
    * Find pages with… “none of these words:”
- **I'm Feeling Lucky**: Consistent with Google’s own behavior, clicking this link would take users directly to the first Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page.
